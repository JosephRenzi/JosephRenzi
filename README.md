Hello,
 I'm a recent PhD graduate in partial differential equations.
 My research focused on developing new techniques for qualitatively describing and solving complex nonlinear PDEs, 
  with applications in fluid dynamics and materials science. 
 I have a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and scientific computing,
  complemented by proficiency in programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, and C++.
 Throughout my academic journey, I've honed my ability to tackle intricate problems, analyze large datasets,
  and communicate complex ideas effectively.
 I'm particularly interested in applying my skills to real-world challenges in industries,
  where my expertise in mathematical modeling and data analysis can drive innovation and provide valuable insights.
